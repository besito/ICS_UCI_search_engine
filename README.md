# ICS_UCI_search_engine
A search engine within the ics.uci.edu domain without the use of any indexing libraries

The HTML parser gets all text in a page, even the non-visible, such as images names. We think that this was particularly useful for the performance of our search engine. 
Moreover, the TF-IDF measure was used to order the relevance of each document giving a specific query. For each result, the URL of the document is shown, the positions of the query in it and the TF-IDF score of the document. We tried different normalization schemes of TF and the best results were obtained when no normalization was used. Although this creates a bias towards documents with many terms, in our collection this works well, since we have many short documents with just a directory. In case of normalization, these non-useful documents were prioritized and documents with meaningful content were shown lower in the results. Moreover, we decided to pre-computed all TF-IDF scores for all terms and documents in our index and store the results for further use.
We preprocess each query, by modifying it to lowercase, removing stopwords and applying a stemmer. In the first query, we show that stopwords (e.g. “and”) are ignored by our search engine.
